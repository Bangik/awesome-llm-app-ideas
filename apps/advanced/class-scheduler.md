- **Prerequisites**: To work on this project, you should have intermediate knowledge of programming, web development, and experience working with LLMs or NLP technologies. Familiarity with Python, Django, and NLP libraries is beneficial.

- **Estimated MVP Time**: Building the basic scheduling engine may take approximately 40-50 hours.

- **Resources Needed**: Access to a development environment (Python, Django, web development tools) and relevant LLMs or NLP libraries is required.
